# DetectiveStory
This was my first project released on the Play Market.
I didn't rewrite the code (although there is a lot to rewrite there) and left everything in its original form.

About the game:
Ethan Morrison is a detective. He will have to investigate the murder of Sofia Ruzal, an extreme victim who was found scratched numbers. 
With each descent down the tunnels, the main character begins to slowly lose his mind
